# DOE Package Manager

This repository holds the code for the DOE package manager.

DOE is the acronym for "Dumb and Over-Engineered".
It can also be a cute animal and to be honest there's no better project names
than cute animals.

Anyway I'm not going to write more than this.
I just needed to store my `dotfiles` and I ended up creating this because I have
masochistic tendencies and because I (wrongly) think that I'm too cool for just
a simple repository.

Needless to say, **do not use this** for any kind of production environment, or
for anything critical or sensitive. First because I wrote this with my left
buttcheek so it's probably going to break, second because I will **not** help
you if it does break, and third because I will laugh at you (a lot) if you lose
any important data because you trusted a software literally called "dumb and
over-engineered".

## Installation

Just build and install with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

That's the only way, as I would feel terribly bad if this big pile of dung was
using some of the world's storage space by being stored precompiled somewhere.
